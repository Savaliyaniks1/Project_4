1) Description :- 
The Mobile Phone Pricing Model aims to develop a predictive model that estimates phone prices based on various features. Our project involves identifying the key features that significantly influence mobile phone prices through feature extraction and analysis.

2) Key Features:-
 Our model uses the following key features to predict phone prices:
- Screen size
- RAM
- Storage
- Model color
- Processor speed
- Operating system
- Release date

3) Objectives :-
- Our objectives are to: Develop a predictive model that accurately estimates phone prices. 
- Identify the most influential features that affect phone prices. 
- Provide strategic recommendations to the organization for refining pricing strategies and marketing decisions.

4) Methodology :-
   
 Our methodology involves the following key steps:
- Data Exploration
- Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and value ranges
- Data Preprocessing under measure the  Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies *
- Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding
- Feature Extraction * Identified the most relevant features using: + Statistical methods (correlation analysis) + Visualizations + Feature importance techniques (feature selection, dimensionality reduction)
  
5) Model Building :-
  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms: Linear regression, Decision trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting
- Evaluated model performance using metrics: Mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Feature Importance Analysis: Confirmed the significance of identified features through model feature importance scores

6) Report and Visualization: Created a comprehensive report or presentation summarizing findings + Including visualizations and insights related to feature importance and their impact on price prediction

7) Recommendations * Provided strategic recommendations to the organization based on the identified influential features, aiding in refining pricing strategies and marketing decisions
